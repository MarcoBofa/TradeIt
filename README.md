#TradeIt

The application provides a fun, weekly stock trading competition for users interested in investing and trading. Every weekend, when the market is closed, users can select 3 stocks they think will perform best over the period of the competition. The application then tracks the performance of these stocks throughout the week and ranks users based on their portfolio's performance. The user with the best performance becomes the winner for the week. The application also features a watchlist where user can see real time data about their favourite stocks and a leaderboard displaying user rankings for both the current and previous weeks.
